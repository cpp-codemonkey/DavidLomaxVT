Classical Ving Tsun 
is an explosive style of Southern Chinese Shaolin Kung Fu predicated on internal power development, sound body mechanics and is expressed in vicious techniques.
 
100% Authenticity Guaranteed – passed down by Ip Man to Grandmaster Victor Kan- the pre-eminent authority on Classical Ving Tsun and one of Ip Man’s top students from the 1950’s. Internationally renowned as the ‘King of Chi Sau’ and was granted permission by Ip Man to teach the late Bruce Lee the first and most important form ‘Sil Nim Tao’. Ip Man once told his two sons that Grandmaster Kan is the man they should complete their studies with after his passing in 1972.

After simplicity - remove what is underneath.

Put new one under simpilicity:
Title - Wing Chun nowadays.
- Modified version 
In most of the videos you only can see the student standing still as a dummy, letting the instructor attack him with all kinds of fancy movements. Their chi sao is just rapid rolling movement. There is no chi in it at all. Impressive to the eyes, but doubtful of practical value. (in big font) Only for the show.

- Imitation version
Since the Yip Man movie and plus one and a half years of the Covid-19 problem. Some self learnt it "no instructor". Copy and imitate the  Wing Chun basic hand movement from the movie and the videos. Then to teach the innocent people with wrong explanation and application. These kinds of people are Wing Chun opportunists.
